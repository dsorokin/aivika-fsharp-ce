    <summary>The F# library for discrete event simulation, system dynamics and agent-based modeling.</summary>
    <description>Aivika for .NET is a multi-paradigm simulation library, a port of the Haskell library of the same name and created by the same author.

The main idea is that many simulation activities can actually be represented as abstract computations. Functional programming has a developed apparatus for creating such computations, combining them, reasoning about them and so on. This is monads, streams, arrows etc. It is important that F# provides an easy-to-use syntactic sugar for working with such computations, which is a clue to practical usability of the method.</description>
